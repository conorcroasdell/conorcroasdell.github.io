<p>pp17. &ldquo;Recently, many designers have
become excited about experimental material design, often driven by the need to
find more sustainable material solutions. However, designers have often worked
alone or within the designer community, without proper support to further develop
and scale-up their most feasible ideas. At the same time, scientific material research
has resulted in ground-breaking findings, which, with help from designers, could be
applied in everyday life. As collaboration is crucial for the future, we want to share
some tips on how to carry this out in practice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>pp.25 &ldquo;Designers use their imagination and skills to utilize waste streams, for example, or to create new materials
from unexpected sources. In addition to material development projects, designers
and artists use speculative design and design fiction to present alternative material
futures and to raise awareness of the urgent need for sustainability. Instead of offering solutions, they ask questions and encourage their audience to react – and act. &quot;</p>
<p>pp.27 <img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/myc0101.png" alt=""></p>
<p>pp.44 &ldquo;Label material samples clearly and document
experiments systematically. During this
research, detailed notes were made about the
material in a notebook and shared digitally&rdquo;</p>
<p>-This is important for my practice with the 3D Printing Project settings and prototypes, too.</p>
<p><strong>INSPIRATION (Chapter Name): Quotes which relate to my vision and story for the Mycelium Watch project:</strong></p>
<p><em>Connections between human well-being and materials from nature</em></p>
<p>Sara Lucía Rueda Mejía</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the course, some of
the key insights I gained were the type of emotions that arose while handling biobased materials, and the increasing sense of closeness to and oneness with nature.
This sense grew every day&hellip; Therefore, for me these
materials became a media for designing experiences for learning to discover and
grasp relationships between emotions and nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Hope needed: Tackling climate anxiety through material experimentation</em></p>
<p>Yu Chen &amp; Chiao-wen Hsu, 2019</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of our project, we sought to create materials associated
with certain emotions triggered by climate issues. We decided to focus on using
agricultural waste: tomato stems from green house cultivation. However, we soon
realized that the emotions linked to the materials varied from one individual to  another. Rather than defining the feelings evoked by the materials, we probed into
the diverse attributes of biomaterials, enabling them to convey the complexity of  our climate-related feelings, and providing the audience with an opportunity to perceive and confront these issues&hellip; When dealing with climate change, emotions and feelings are unavoidably
aroused, of which we are sometimes unaware of these. Our intention was, through
material action, to create awareness of these emotions, engage with the issues,
create positive emotions, and take further action to fight against eco-anxiety and
climate change, as well as advance social sustainability in accordance with SDG No.3
Good Health and Well-being and environmental sustainability.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>What about growing a mycelium leather in the mycelium watch ? - grow the strap too? As a bio factory on your wrist</em></p>
<p><strong>Bio Design: Nature, Science, Creativity</strong> by William Myers</p>
<p><strong>Notes &amp; Quotes</strong></p>
<p>pp.6</p>
<p>Collaboration between fields where the different skillsets and perspectives of both parties complement each other, filling in the gaps of eachother&rsquo;s knowledge and checking each others assumptions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Designers fascination with science is today reciprocated by a generation of scientists who are eager to get their brains dirty with reality&hellip; these novel collaborations are often joyous contaminations in which scientist feel, even if just for a moment, liberated by the rigor of peer review and free to attempt intuitive leaps&rdquo;</p>
<p>pp7</p>
<p>If its purpose is to be an educational, ambassadorial project to promote biodesign then the living jewellery piece and its exhibition should, if successful &ldquo;have the lyrical and demonstrative power of art and the realistic possibilities of design&rdquo;</p>
<p>pp9</p>
<p>Important questions for the field of biodesign, from the foreword by William Myers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we avoid thinking of life as simply another material or tool without extending it due respect? Can we unlearn our fear aspects of biology, such as invisible microbes, and embrace a design that utilizes them? Can designers learn to empathise with other forms of life and surrender a small amount of control of their work to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this new sensitivity of designers to biology and cross-disciplinary collaboration amounts to a paradigm shift for society, how does this shift &ldquo;compare with other field-changing shifts in the trajectory of technological developments, from industrialization to the invention of computers?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2. Ecological Object Engineering</strong></p>
<p>We are already biodesigning, bio engineering in such fields as pharmaceuticals, food, agri-science and  petro(bio)chemicals. These are highly regulated, slow moving industries. There is much fertile ground for the faster paced, less regulated world of product design then, to explore applications of bio-tech which have a lower barrier of entry but still hold many opportunities for facilitating the move to a more circular, bio-inclusive existence for humanity.</p>
<p>pp 88
The project &ldquo;A Radical Means&rdquo; by designer Damian Palin shows a less energy intensive method of creating molded, strong products by using a mix of sand and microorganism impregnated minerals which turn the sand into stone over time. The final form is influenced by the growth pattern of the microorganisms. If they don&rsquo;t spread perfectly then the stool will not appear perfect either, being turned to stone in only some places. The result is more thought provoking than a perfectly mass produced object. Natures role in the design is paid respect to in this way instead of being hidden or forced into an industrial definition of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/myc8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>pp 99
The microbial home project, by Phillips Design working with Jack Mama and Clive van Heerdan, is a concept interior of a home designed to work as an ecosystem, maximising the use of the energy which passes through our homes.</p>
<p>The mycelium jewellery project demonstrates how we might better use just one of the many wasted energy sources created each and every human. In this case the intimate form of often wasted energy - our body heat.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/myc9-02.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>pp 189
The Biological Atelier project, from Amy Congdon at Central Saint Martins' Material Futures program, uses conceptual prototypes inspired by real science in development to show a speculative future where garments are grown, not made.</p>
<p>This is also part of what I want to show with the mycelium jewellery but in a prototype instead of a concept, to make this future more visible and tangible to reach the public&rsquo;s imagination. People should see it and say: &quot; If this is what is possible now, then what crazy opportunities there must be for biodesign in the future!?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic Fungi - 2019, Documentary, Louie Schwartzberg:</strong></p>
<p>Points for communicating the importance, possibility of mycelium and, importantly, what it is:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fungi are the recyclers of nature&rdquo; 3:00</p>
<p>Mushrooms signify rebirth, the energy from the dead matter is used to feed the growth of the mushrooms which go on to fertilize the soil and act as a part of the food chain, returning that energy to living. They are the link between death and new life.</p>
<p>Fungi are in between plants and animals, the mycelium jewellery showcases this unique position: you see mycelium searching for food, fighting contamination in an animal like way and also see the fruiting and sporulation reminiscent of a plant. A mini-snapshot of nature&rsquo;s intelligence happening in real time, including our impact on it via the with climate change via the metaphor of our body heat acting as global warming/ habitat destruction</p>
<p>&ldquo;A window into the invisible landscape beneath our feet&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mushrooms and mycelium are the communication system for nature, transferring nutrients from plant to plant in exchange for sugars and even warning of oncoming threats to their plant partners like diseases via their underground network of roots, known as mycelium. They balance the ecosystem and help it respond to changes. There could be many benefits to society to investigate their uses further and work with their capabilities.</p>
<p>They share the nutrients throughout the forest.</p>
<p>Of all the millions of species of fungi about 20000 produce mushrooms.</p>
<p>Mycelium broke the rock sown into soil to enable for the rest of life on land.</p>
<p>Mycelium can break down hydrocarbons into bioavailable nutrients. Could you break plastic down with mycelium and then process it into a biodegradable alternative to plastic?</p>
