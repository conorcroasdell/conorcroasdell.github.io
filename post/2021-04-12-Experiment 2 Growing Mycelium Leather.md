## Goal ##

To grow a layer of mycelium which can be processes and used in making the living jewellery.

## Method 1: Growing on Liquid Nutrients ##

First I started with trying ou this method posted by Elise to the BioFabForum: https://biofabforum.org/t/method-of-making-mycelium-leather/218 I used Ganoderma Lucidum as I didn't have any Schizophyllum Commune.

*"You need 1/2 to 1 agar plate of mycelium (e.g. species Trametes Versicolor, Schizophyllum commune, Pleurotus ostreatus).*

*Remove all the agar to keep pure mycelium*

*Inoculate the pure mycelium in a sterilised liquid nutrient-rich medium*
*For example:*

*Malt extract 3g*
*Yeast extract 3g*
*Peptone 5g*
*Glucose 10g*
*Distilled water: 1000ml*
*Sterilise the medium by autoclaving at 121°C for 15 minutes*

*Let it grow in static position in a container of the desired size*

*Incubation at 23-28°C for 5-10 days*

*The mycelium will grow at the surface of the liquid and fill the size of the container.*

*Add more nutrient medium under the sheet of mycelium with a syringe after 5-10 days.*

*Incubate again for 5-10 days. The growth time depends on the dimensions of the container.*

*Harvest the mycelium sheet*

*Dry it at 70-130C for several hours. This step can also be skipped. So, first plasticise the mycelium-sheet while the organism is still alive and the sheet still humid. The mycelium sheet can also be heat-pressed.*

*Let the mycelium-sheet soak in a plasticiser (glycerol, choline chloride:ethylene glycol, …) for several hours (24-48h).*

*Rinse the sheet of mycelium abundantly to make sure all the plasticiser is removed.*

*Dry it again at 70-130C for several hours"*

After 6 Days there was growth but not as much outward growth on the surface as I had hoped.

## What about many innoculation Points? ##

Upon looking at the 6 day progress of the liquid grown G.Lucidum, I thought that the growth of the mycelium could be sped up immensely cutting up the inocculating mycelium into as small pieces as possible in order to get as much surface area in contact with the nutrients as possible.

Rather than use a Petri dish of agar grown mycelium to innoculate a container of nutrient liquid I decided to instead thoroughly innoculate the nutrient medium first and then pour the mycelium/nutrient liquid mix into the container and let it grow. A magnetic stir bar inside a glass jar containing the nutrient mix and 1/2 to 1 Petri dish worth broken up mycelium pieces. The stir bar breaks up these initial mycelium pieces into many smaller ones, each of which is a new innoculation point. This process continues as the mixture continues to be stirrefd. Ideally the liquid would be temperature controlled at 25 Celsius to speed up colonisation time, however, I didn't have the ability to do that for my first test with this method.
