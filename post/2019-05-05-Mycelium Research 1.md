**Mycelium Research in chronological order:**

 Textiles w/ mycelium:
https://neffa.nl/portfolio/mycelium-textile/

Topic: Growing mycelium on textiles

Species: schizophyllum

Findings:

Mycelium does not like to grow on a tight knitted or woven fabric. It needs space and openness to grow. (oxygen)

The mycelium did not use the textiles as food, even over 6 months.

**making mycelium material – some loose protocols:**

http://www.o-matic.com/blog/blog/2014/08/04/making-mycelium-material-some-loose-protocols/

Good Tip:

"nut bags (or other mesh bags) to pasteurize substrate (easy to squeeze water out)"

Steps to make m:

heat water to 160º

pasteurize substrate for 10-15 minutes

clean all work surfaces and mold interior and exterior with alcohol and dry

wash hands and arms with soap, wear gloves for the next steps:

cool substrate until you can handle it

squeeze all excess water from substrate (you want it moist but not dripping at all)

put air filter into hole in mold

mix grain spawn with substrate; there are 2 ways to do this:
“lasagna” method of layering substrate then spawn, or
premix 1:5 spawn: substrate
either way, the ratio is about 20%, might be less needed

pack mold with spawn

keep somewhere between 70º – 80º
(I keep my molds in a loosely closed cardboard box to prevent contaminants drifting in the air or falling from the ceiling)

You should have a pretty solid material after 6-12 days
It will look very white and fuzzy
Remove from mold
Dry in open air (it should no longer risk contamination at this point) for 3 days or until dry to touch

Bake in over at 150• – 200º for 60 minutes to render mycelium inert.

Topic:

An exploration of innovative mycological building materials and ideas for their application. Updated November 2013. University of Kent"

Relevant quotes:

*"However, the issue of sterile conditions and the emitted CO2 emissions to achieve them, the sourcing of substrate materials and their adequate storage still questions the true sustainability of this natural material"*

Common practice for drying mycelium to make it inactive:
*"if they are dehydrated to a moisture content <30%, the hyphae become entirely inactive and the growth process cannot be restarted.*

Topic:
Research into processes, applications, reinforcement materials, timeframes for production. References @ end are useful for further research

Relevant quotes:

* "...by using enzymes to convert
cellulose in the substrate into chitin, a strong compound found in crustacean exoskeletons. The chitin acts like an adhesive, bonding the substrate particles together." *

* " Coffee grounds were then added to some substrate, since
some mushroom growers have found that the nitrogen in coffee acts as a sort of fertilizer and increases
growth rates"..."The addition of coffee increased the strength of both the plywood and mixed sawdust swatches,
though it negatively affected the hardwood strength. However, the hardwood with coffee added had greater mycelial growth" *


* "The optimal conditions for curing,
according to Philip Ross, are baking at 200 degrees Fahrenheit for 3 or more hours, depending on the thickness of the final product" *

* "We observed that the mycelium felt less fragile when grown with support materials that had
smaller holes, like the screens, burlap, and nylon mesh" *

**MYCELIUM RUNNING, How Mushrooms Can Help Save the World, PAUL STAMETS, 2005**

Topic: Book about the wide ranging applications and potential for mycelium by mushroom uber nerd Paul Stamets.

Relevant quotes & notes, pages:

Page 161 - 162 : On Cold Incubation,

*By keeping the substrate below temps at which competing life can grow (35 to 50 Fahrenheit) and choosing the right mycelium strain (e.g. oyster, enoki) which is able to grow in these low temps you can increase your chances of growing mycelium on straw successfully outside of a lab environment.*

*Keep in the shade or cover with something if in an unshaded spot*

*10-30% mycelium of the total mass of substrate is recommended*

Page 162 - 163 : On Peroxide treatment

*Mycelium sweats peroxidase enzymes to break down plant fibers but also to kill foreign spores. By treating the substrate with peroxide ( hydrogen peroxide) first before inoculating, you can give the mycelium a head start against the competitors.*

Peroxide treatment procedure is described in full on page 162

Page 163 - :Heat Pasteurization

*Heat the material in water at 160 Fahrenheit for 1 hour (for 100 to 150 lbs of wet straw)*

*Apply the spores directly after removing the straw from the pasteurizing tank, spread it out on a sterile surface for quick cooling. Then the mycelium spores should be immediately added to the substrate once the temperature is below that which will kill the mycelium. Adding the mycelium spores of a vigorously colonising type such as the Oyster as soon as possible on the pasteurized straw means that the mycelium can grow strong enough before other organisms can get a foothold, they typically take around 10 days to emerge. If you pasteurise at too hot a temperature you can also kill microbial allies, (over 190 Fahrenheit) black and pink mold can then occur within 1 or 2 days.*

Page 265: Notes for incubating colonising mycelium:

*65 to 75 Fahrenheit is ideal for most mycelium to incubate at and colonising. Avoid fluctuations in temperature as they will hinder the mycelium and cause condensation which can carry contaminants from one location  to another.*

*23:40  - 30% of plant matter is decomposed into mycelium to create water. Lenses of mycelium grow, they hydrate the environment around them"*
