**Research Stage 1**
19/11/18 - 25/11/18:

I began by researching the different types of e-bikes and the history of e-bikes overall. After settling on the friction drive as the variant which best fits my project, I looked into the existing friction drive offerings, both D.I.Y. and commercial. I found friction drive designs from the late 1800s until now. I particularly noticed the recent trend in popularity of small friction drive kits being released, often through crowdfunding. I think this recent popularity is due, at least partly, to the recent decrease in price in battery and motor technology. These offerings are still quite expensive for many, as a result, some detailed, open, D.I.Y. versions have arisen. I have found these to be very useful the research for my project as well as the commercial versions.

  Notes:

  Various references relevant to me for further reading

  the EN15194 standard [8] to decide if an electric bicycle is still accounted as such

"Pedalling sensing is possible as the chain
movement can be directly sensed at the rear wheel" - [pg.3]

"there is a strong trend towards e-bikes [19] with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 55% in
Europe," - [pg.4]

"y (94.4% in 2014) of the bicycles sold are still non-electric off-the-shelf bicycles [2]"- [pg.4]

" to define a target customer group based on their requirements. It was
concluded that an electrification solution is more appropriate for commuters and entry-level leisure
cyclists, as other users would be willing to spend higher amounts to obtain a bicycle that is more
suitable for their individual applications" - [pg. 5]
