**Updated E- Bike Kit: 2021**

Reason for updating:

The current version of the kit fits many types of bikes and is light and easy to attach/ remove but you have to be careful not to overstress the motor (by going up a hill, for example) because the ESC is dumb and will send more current than the motor windings can handle and they will burn out. The current design also uses a sliding 10K Ohm sliding potentiometer, mounted on the handlebar, as a throttle. To make the kit legal as a non registered E-Bike (called officially a pedelec) in the E.U. it must be activated by the pedals turning and only do so while the bike is already moving. This means it is “pedal assist” and not an electric motorcycle which must be registered and which requires a license to drive.

Microcontroller:

Arduino

Other:

 I also used some jumper wires and a 50k Ohm linear, sliding potentiometer


POTENTIAL NEW PARTS:

Motor: Large diameter and lower rpm/ volt for more torque and reduced slipping on the tyre.

Speed Controller:

V-ESC (Variable Electronic Speed Controller) instead of just an ESC. The open source VESC can be configured with current limits and many other settings. unlike the ESC which simply tries to maintain a constant RPM, regardless of the current, which can burn out the motor windings in high load situations.
