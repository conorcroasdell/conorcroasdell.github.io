**Bio-Dyes:**

How did Suzanne Lee Seal her leather? Or did she?

Natural dyes: Safflower, Cherry Blossom, and Japanese Indigo

They use a porous plastic which soaks up the natural dyes. This gets around the problem of natural dyes not penetrating plastic well by hugely increasing the surface area. This porous surface is of course not as conducive to cleaning as a smooth one.

*Research Paper*

Dyes were created from Curcumin (the colour from Turmeric) and Saffron

The fibres were pre-treated with ozone/UV first (I think this is also intended to increase surface area in order to improve dyeability)

Polyester fabric they used is the same polymer I use in my 3D prints as most drinks bottles are made from.
