      <p>Today we stated growing samples of Ganoderma mycelium on agar.</p>
<p>I am following this shroomery.org forum post, &ldquo;Stro&rsquo;s Cleaning and Isolating On Agar&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/18430998/fpart/1/vc/1/nt/3">https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Number/18430998/fpart/1/vc/1/nt/3</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Task:</strong></p>
<p>To make agar plates with the mycelium at the lab. Firstly In order to see if it is still alive and if so to attempt to isolate a appropriately fast growing and rhizomorphic culture for use in the watch face of the mycelium watch and potentially in other mycelium living jewellery pieces (self manufacturing ((growing)) bracelet, earrings, pendants).</p>
<p><strong>Rationale:</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to grow the samples on the different types of agar + different concentrations to see what produces the fastest growth/ most interesting pattern. I will take notes &amp; photos during growth for making a library of samples.</p>
<p>I read some people who say not enough nutrients is what triggers the rhizomorphic growth which is the fastest and most visually interesting and some people say the opposite. With this experiment I want to find out for myself how to encourage rhizomorphic growth.</p>
<h1 id="step-one---the-first-agar-plates">Step one - The first agar plates</h1>
<p>First we began with a mix of agar that I know works because I have used it before in my first attempts making a mycelium &ldquo;watch&rdquo; at my internship at Waag.</p>
<p><strong>The recipe:</strong></p>
<p>500 ml MYA (malt + yeast agar) Recipe&hellip;
10 grams Agar
7.5 grams Malt Extract
.25 grams powdered Nutritional Yeast
A living culture of Ganoderma mycelium to inoculate with
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc26.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>(Modified recipe for 750ml:
13.3 Agar
10 Malt
.3125 Yeast
750ml demi-water)</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<p>10 mycelium samples were placed on malt, yeast agar petri dishes</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc23.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The mycelium samples were harvested from a block of birdseed with Ganoderma mycelium grown through it. This block was already in the fridge at Bluecity Lab. We weren&rsquo;t sure how old this mycelium was and if it was still alive.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc21.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The A samples were harvested from the centre of the mycelium block.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc25.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The B samples were harvested from the outer, more &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo; part of the block.</p>
<p>Some dishes have one piece of the birdseed/mycelium placed in the centre of the dishes</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc24.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Some of the dishes have 3 pieces which are placed in the shape of a triangle. This is done to give different samples a chance to grow at once. This way even if only one of them grows at all or if one grows much stronger than the other 2, then that one colony can be harvested by itself for further use. This also allows me to see how separate mycelium colonies on an agar layer interact with each other during growth.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/myc17.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The inoculated plates were placed in an incubator at 25 Celsius.</p>

<p><strong>End of 7 days:</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;B&rdquo; group were all contaminated with bread mould by this point. By far the most successful sample from the &ldquo;A&rdquo; group was A5 which had grown to cover the entire dish in a tough layer of mycelium, with fluffy areas on the surface.</p>
<p>I assume from my reading that one of the colonies of mycelium has become dominant over the other two placed on the agar in A5 but the interaction between the different colonies wasn&rsquo;t visible with a daily check-up. It would be interesting to film/ timelapse the entire week long process.</p>
<p>I think it would have attempted fruiting if I left it 1-2 weeks longer.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4007.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4002.jpg" alt="The surface of the A5 plate"></p>
<p>The second winner, A3,  seems to have stopped growing in the last couple of days. It didnt spread out to cover the entire plate but stayed in 3 individual colonies. From the photo below you can see that the mycelium didn&rsquo;t spread downwards into the agar much either. I wonder what caused this stoppage of growth?</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4001.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Generation 2: Isolating A3 &amp; A5</strong></p>
<p>I cut samples from A3 and A5 and inoculated 5 new agar (MYA) plates for each.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4003.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The samples from A3 grew much faster and in a more tomentose (fluffy) manner but after 1 day were all showing at least some signs of contamination from the black bread mould. Perhaps this contamination was already somehow present in A3. That might offer some explanation for A3&rsquo;s stopped growth.</p>
<p>The A5 samples, on the other hand, were showing ordered growth outwards along the surface of the agar. As seen in A5-2:
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4004.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Day 5</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4005.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The A5 samples have grown faster and in a more rhisomorphic manner in the second generation than in the first generation. This is a good sign that the isolation is working, providing me with faster, more rhizomorphic growing colonies of mycelium.</p>
<p>A5-1 &amp; A5-2 had not grown out as far or as uniformly, although A5-1 rolled to the side of the agar plate and so is not useful for comparisons. A5-2 seems to contain many strains of mycelium in comparison to A5-3 &amp; A5-5 in particular, whose growth is in a relatively even circular form. This implies that A5-3 &amp; A5-5 contain an isolated strain of mycelium. In contrast, A5-4 contains 2 distict &ldquo;rings&rdquo; of mycelium growth. Implying 2 or more strains are present.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4008.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This ordered, outward growth can be seen clearly when looking at the back of the agar plate with some light behind:</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4006.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>End of 7 days</strong></p>
<p>After 7 days, samples A5-3 and A5-5 had continued their, ordered outward growth to cover the entire plate.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4009.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4010.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4011.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4012.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A5-4 has also grown to cover almost the entire surface of the agar. 2 strains of growth are still visible, with the strain on the bottom half (relative to the above photo) seeming to have won out.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4013.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="generation-3">Generation 3</h2>
<p>I used PDYA ( Potatoe Dextrose Yeast Agar) with added activated carbon for the next round of isolation in order to give the Ganoderma mycelium more and a greater variety of food in hope of increasing the &ldquo;health&rdquo; of the colonies.</p>
<p>I read adding activated charcoal can be beneficial here:</p>
<p>Potato Dextrose Agar Recipe from Reddit post: &ldquo;Rhizomorphic Mycellium on Agar&rdquo;
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/7mso04/rhizomorphic_mycellium_on_agar/">https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/7mso04/rhizomorphic_mycellium_on_agar/</a></p>
<p>However the charcoal didn&rsquo;t dissolve. Smaller particles remained suspended in agar nut larger ones sunk to the bottom:</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc4015.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>The A5 samples:</strong></p>
<p>A5-3,A5-4 &amp; A5-5 were selected to transfer to the new agar mix.</p>
<p>6 samples were cut in triangle shape from the freshest growth at the edges of each plate and inoculated on 2x PDYA plates and 4x PDYA + AC (Activated Charcoal) plates each for comparison.</p>
<p>They were incubated once again at 26 Celsius for a week.</p>

<h2 id="generation-5">Generation 5</h2>
<p>Now I have</p>
<p><strong>Progress Report &amp; the next tests in this experiment</strong></p>
<p>The isolation of rhizomorphic strains seems to have been successful again. The growth of this round of samples is visually less &ldquo;fluffy&rdquo; than the last. The nutrients are different however making it hard to compare.</p>
<p>Next I will transfer the &ldquo;winner&rdquo; from these samples back to the MYA to see how this isolated strain behaves on each nutrient mix which has caused the increase in rhizomorphic growth over tomentose. After this MYA v.s. PDYA test I will do one more test with a nutrient mix with half the concentration for comparison. I read that tomentose vs rhizomorphic growth can be affected by nutrient concentration as well as the growth rate of the mycelium as it spreads out looking for food.</p>
<p>The effect on growth rate is interesting for me because it is important that the mycelium jewellery doesn&rsquo;t grow too slowly or too quickly. The wearer must be able to notice the difference from day to day. The jewellery should not be entirely finished growing after just one night, for example. The wearer must be given the time to form a bond with their mycelium. From my own tests wearing my previous prototype, I think 1-2 weeks is the right time frame for this.</p>
<h2 id="update-5321-stage-2">Update 5/3/21: Stage 2</h2>
<p><strong>Until now I have been working with an unknown culture of an unknown Ganoderma species which I found in the fridge. I started with this because it was what was available for me to get started with immediately - to gain experience working with mycelium on agar. The purpose of the selection and re-plating process so far has been to clean up this strain from any contaminants and to select for &ldquo;ropey&rdquo; rhizomorphic growth. Work with growing and selecting further species will be done with already  somewhat isolated, healthy cultures which I have been given or purchased. With these I estimate to be able to cut the time and number of selection/re-growth cycles needed to find my &ldquo;jewellery worthy&rdquo; specimen in half.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My new protocol for isolating the rest of the species is as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Grow out 3 samples from the aquired species to fill a 90/100mm PDYA Petri with the species. Incubate at 25 Celsius.</p>
<p>There should be no contamination and you can continue to step 2, if there is: cut out a healthy section,  re-plate on PDYA and repeat step 1.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Select the petri with the most isolated mycelium strain ( look for evenly long, outward growth with the desired form of growth such as rhizomorphic or tomentose) Take 6 triangular sections from regularly spaced intervals from the newest mycelium at the edges of the dish. See my photos earlier in this page for visual guide.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Grow these 6 samples out on MYA petri dishes.</p>
<p>If you are happy with the level of isolation and/or the selected properties of the samples. You can seal with parafilm refrigerate them for storage. If you feel they require further isolation or selection, repeat steps <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong>.</p>
