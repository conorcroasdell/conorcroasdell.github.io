In the beginning, my plan was to attempt to reproduce HomoFaciens' design as it is the most easily reproduced, using only 3D printed and hardware store items.

The original maker had tweaked his original design as he went to a level where it functioned quite reliably for him even for long prints. I thought I could reproduce his design and then document & test it more completely to maybe make some improvements.

**Making it:**

Unfortunately, reproducing his results was not as easy as I had hoped. Rather than continuing with this design, I decided I could make better use of my time by taking what I had learned about what does/doesn't work from reproducing this design and combining it with what I had read about more professionally made/ consumer made "granule printers" in order to create my own design.

Attached to the printer and filled with plastic

Plastic was collected from the Digital Station at WDKA for testing with the print head.

Attempts were made to print with corse (approx.3mm) ground plastic.

Also tried was much finer plastic, obtained by passing the grounds through a sieve

On both attempts no plastic was extruded through the nozzle.

When the heating block was removed it was clear that the plastic had melted but was not pushed through the nozzle. I think this has to do with the screw being a smaller diameter than the 8mm melting chamber, allowing the plastic to flow back upwards around the screw threads.

An attempt was made using a snug fitting, 8mm drill bit which extruded for a moment before becoming clogged. The clogging, I think, was caused by the heat travelling up and melting the plastic slightly at the top of the heating chamber.

I attempted to add more cooling with aluminium sheets between the heating chamber and the rest of the printer head but the heat still travelled up, enough to partially melt the so called "cold end" into the 3D printed hopper piece.

I think the closeness of the heating chamber and the cold end is the downfall of this design. The original designer seems to have progressively added cooling between the hot and cold end until this problem was solved. The resulting heatsink was quite big and unwieldy. I have no doubt that with more tweaking I could have eventually gotten this design to work as he did.







I decided I would swith my approach and attempt to take one of these existing designs and make it more easily reproducable for others, instead of taking an already firmly D.I.Y.-ish design and trying to improve on it. This way I can work from existing designs which have research and good documentation as a guide. These designs are typically expensive or complicated to reproduce because of the creators' goal involving the ability to produce low tolerance parts which fit together with their design. I and many others in art and design don't require this level of accuracy, who cares if your bowl or sculpture is 1mm off the measurement? Especially if what you are printing has been designed with those loose tolerances in mind from the beginning. I see a fertile niche for a designer like myself to take these more engineered designs and make them more easily.

This lead me to my second attempt, outlined in the [next installment] <https://conorcroasdell.github.io/post/2021-04-14-Recycling%203D%20Printer%20Attempt%202/>...
