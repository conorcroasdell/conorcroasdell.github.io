      <h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>To gain experience practical experience with and to observe the entire process and variables involved in making mycelium/lignocellulose composites (with Ganoderma mycelium as the matrix, Flax as the substrate and Spray Millet as the grain spawn).</p>
<p>The Ganoderma mycelium used has been isolated and grown by myself and was taken from the centre of a bag of colonised grain spawn which had been in the fridge for some months by a colleague at the lab. The species wasn&rsquo;t listed.</p>
<h2 id="preparatory-stage">Preparatory Stage:</h2>
<p>To make the mycelium/ flax composite material it is first recommended to grow out the mycelium in a nutrient dense food source like a seed/ grain.
By doing this the mycelium already has a food source and has begun growing when it is introduced to the flax, meaning it&rsquo;s more resilient to contamination and can grow faster.</p>
<p>Some say that grains with a smaller size are best as they give the mycelium many inoculation points to begin growing through the flax from once added.</p>
<p>This grain with mycelium colonized throughout is commonly called &ldquo;grain spawn&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Preparing Grain Spawn</strong></p>
<p>To understand the process a bit, I bought so called &ldquo;Spray Millet&rdquo;, still on the stalk, and went through the process of separating the grains myself:</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2254.jpg" alt="">
Spray Millet on the stalk</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2255.jpg" alt="">
After shaking the grains free from the stalks. You can see there is still a lot of dirt and broken shells.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2258.jpg" alt="">
By pouring the millet into water, the full grains sink and the shells and broken grains float to the surface.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2260.jpg" alt="">
These can then be collected with a sieve.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2261.jpg" alt="">
The removed shells</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2263.jpg" alt="">
The full seeds. They should be soaked for 24 hours to soften up the seeds to allow the mycelium to grow into them more easily. The soaking also allows contaminants present to grow out, meaning they can be killed by the pressure cooking later.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2273.jpg" alt="">
Now the seeds must be simmered for 15 mins to further soften the shells and fill the grains with moisture. Then they should be spread out to dry until the outside of the shells feel dry to the touch but still swollen with water.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2274.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The grains are then added to jars with some kind of air exchange. I used a hole in the lid with some polyurethane foam stuffed in.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2275.jpg" alt="">
The grains are now ready to be pressure cooked or autoclaved.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2297.jpg" alt="">
In this case I added half a petri dish of Ganoderma from Experiment 1 to each jar.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2293.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Make sure the lids aren&rsquo;t tightened completely. Cover them with foil to protect from steam or water entering the jar during autoclaving.</p>
<p><strong>5 Days</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2319.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>11 Days</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2399.jpg" alt="">
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2339.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>When the molds were filled the grain spawn had been colonising for 19 days</strong></p>
<h3 id="flax-preparation">Flax Preparation</h3>
<p>I purchased a 20KG bale of flax waste which would normally be used for animal (usually horse) bedding.</p>
<p>Here is what it looked like, consisting mostly of so-called &ldquo;shrives&rdquo;, waste from  processing the fibre from flax stalks:
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2345.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Half of my tests will use this unprocessed flax waste while the other half will use flax blended in water for 10 mins.</p>
<h2 id="steps">Steps:</h2>
<p>The flax must first be soaked for 24 hours for the same reason as the millet.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2333.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Half of the flax is now ready to be dried until it is dry to the touch but is still full of moisture</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2344.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The other half can now be blended with water. I did this for 10 minutes. The result wasn&rsquo;t completely blended as you can see. With a different blender or by blending for a longer time, this could be improved.</p>
<p>Here you see the blended flax:
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2368.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The portion of the mixture which blended well is, I believe, the part of the flax called the hurds ( a.k.a shrives). The &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; you can see which did not blend as well are another part of the flax plant.</p>
<p>I think this mix of very short fibres and the stronger, larger &ldquo;sticks&rdquo; could give better strength properties for the resulting material than if the flax waste was thoroughly blended.</p>
<p>Interestingly, there were also flax seeds in the waste which germinated after soaking.
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2365.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Next, the blended flax must also be dried. To speed this process up, I first used a sieve to separate the standing water.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2367.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I used an old t-shirt to squeeze out much  of the remaining moisture.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2392.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then It was laid out to dry just like the unblended flax:</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2393.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, both the blended and raw flax waste are ready to be packed into the polypropylene molds. I chose thin walled polypropylene containers because PP has good oxygen exchange properties.</p>
<p>The polypropylene containers can also withstand autoclaving temperatures for sterilisation.</p>
<p>The final preparatory step is to sterilize the flax. I used a pressure cooker to do this.</p>
<h3 id="inoculating-and-packing-the-molds">Inoculating and packing the molds</h3>
<p><strong>Supplies</strong></p>
<p>Scales</p>
<p>Colonized grain spawn</p>
<p>Spoon to compress flax/grain mixture into the molds</p>
<p>Bowl for breaking up the grain spawn</p>
<p>Bowl for mixing flax with grain spawn</p>
<p>Clingfilm for AFC and AF tests</p>
<p>70% alcohol for cleaning any tools and surfaces</p>
<p>Flax (or another cellulose food source)</p>
<p>Molds (in this case 250ml PP fast food containers)</p>
<p>A laminar flow hood or some other sterile environment</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2404.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I added approx. 20% of the weight of the flax in grain spawn to each mold.</p>
<p>At the halfway point of filling each mold I compressed it with the back of the spoon.</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2405.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The filled molds were incubated in the dark in a small indoor PVC greenhouse at between 25 - 30 Celsius (it was unusually hot in the Netherlands!)</p>
<p><img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2495.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>To keep the inside dark I covered it with a bedsheet
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2491.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Day 4</strong></p>
<p>2 blended and 2 non-blended samples were filled with slightly less flax than the others, leaving an approximately 20mm air gap between the top of the flax once filled. This should increase the number of growth points of mycelium within the flax and should speed up growth. This was also done to test the effect of breaking up and mixing the living mycelium on the resulting material&rsquo;s properties.</p>
<p>Underfilling the mold left space for the mixing as well as for a thicker layer of mycelium to grow on the top surface of the flax where the mycelium has plentiful access to air.</p>
<p>These samples were broken up and mixed inside the mold via squeezing by hand as best as could be achieved without opening the mold and were then also shook up by hand.</p>
<p>After breaking up and mixing the materials were compressed upwards against the roof of the mold, again by hand (or rather thumb).</p>
<p>The base of the mold was then pulled back out to its original form. Leaving an air pocket available to the mycelium on the opposite side than the first 4 days. This was done to allow a more massive layer of mycelium to grow on the bottom face of the flax as it had on the top.</p>
<p><strong>Day 8</strong></p>
<p>On the 8th day it was time to remove the samples from the mold.</p>
<p>Firstly, however, approx. half of the samples must be compressed while still in the mold (see index 1 above to see exactly which ones).</p>
<p><em><strong>Compressing Method:</strong></em></p>

<p>The most apparently developed growth by quite a margin was seen on the non compressed sample CFC-2. I don&rsquo;t know why this is because this is one of the blended flax control samples, perhaps by chance more of the grain spawn ended up at the sides of the container in this sample, making it appear more colonised around the outside surface than it really is on the inside:
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2485.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The samples covered with clingfilm in order to limit fresh air exchange and increase the c02 level did grow a fluffy mass on  top of the flax as expected. This makes me want to try growing mycelium foam on a cellulose substrate in a high c02 environment. Increased c02 levels are already known to encourage vertical growth of mycelium which spreads out in search of oxygen as it &ldquo;suffocates&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here you can see how the fluff grew on top of the flax in these samples:
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2487.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the mycelium &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; stuck to the clingfilm:
<img src="https://conorcroasdell.github.io/Myc2480.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The growth of the outer skin did not complete during 8 days as I expected because I didn&rsquo;t add enough water to the substrate (75% of the weight of the flax+ grain spawn).</p>
<h3 id="14-days-slowed-growth">14 Days: Slow(ed) growth</h3>
<p><strong>After 6 days out of the molds, only some of the samples showed patchy growth of the outer skin. I began misting the samples with a plant sprayer (also can be found marketed for spraying weed killer), using boiled water in order hydrate them for another 8 days. Boiling the water will kill some of the potential contaminants in the water. The samples were sprayed from the top and bottom side of all the samples for 10 seconds</strong></p>
<h3 id="18-days-incl-4-days-misting">18 Days (Incl. 4 days misting):</h3>
<p><strong>After 4 days of misting, most samples were around half covered with a mycelium outer skin ranging form fluffy to dense.</strong></p>

Above you can see the mycelium has spread to colonise the masking tape I used as a label to access its cellulose for food.</p>

<p>After 4 more days of misting I will remove the samples for processing.</p>
