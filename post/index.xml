      <description>Encouraging Rhizomorphic Growth I read some people who say not enough nutrients is what triggers the rhizomorphic growth which is the fastest and most visually interesting and some people say the opposite.
I will take my most vigorous samples from Experiment 1 and test them on different varieties and concentrations of agar nutrient mixes:
Potato Dextrose Agar Recipe from Reddit post: &amp;ldquo;Rhizomorphic Mycellium on Agar&amp;rdquo; https://www.reddit.com/r/shrooms/comments/7mso04/rhizomorphic_mycellium_on_agar/
The poster describes the agar recipe used:</description>

      <description>Today we stated growing samples of oyster mycelium on agar.
Task:
To make agar plates with the mycelium at the lab. Firstly In order to see if it is still alive and if so to attempt to isolate a particularly fast growing colony for use in the living jewellery.
Rationale:
The goal is to grow the samples on the different types of agar + different concentrations to see what produces the fastest growth/ most interesting pattern.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Wood Wide Web&amp;rdquo; - Fungi trade nutrients with plants via the mycelium. This enables plants and fungi to access food which they couldn&amp;rsquo;t on their own in a symbiotic relationship. Plants get phosphorous and nitrogen which mycelium make available by breaking down other organic matter and the mycelium get sugars which the plants create via photosynthesis which fungi can&amp;rsquo;t do.
In this way mycelium are a vital part of all life on land.</description>

      <title>Essay: Problems with Recycling Right Now</title>
      <link>https://conorcroasdell.github.io/post/2020-9-21-recycling-essay/</link>

      <description>Why is increased recycling not leading to reduced production of virgin raw materials? You would be forgiven for imagining recycling allows us to put a stop to the endless production of waste which has become ever more recognised as an ecological disaster in recent times. Actually, our current method of recycling has not led to a world where the same waste we put in our recycling bins circulates efficiently, from waste to product, over and over again.</description>

      <description>Why?
In 2nd year I made vases and bowls using a modification to the settings of a 3D printer to make surface effects with the layer lines, as you see here:
The reasoning for the project was to show that final products can already be made with cheap 3D printers. The layer lines on 3D printed parts are often seen as ugly and a reason why 3D printers are only good for prototypes.</description>

Natural dyes: Safflower, Cherry Blossom, and Japanese Indigo
They use a porous plastic which soaks up the natural dyes. This gets around the problem of natural dyes not penetrating plastic well by hugely increasing the surface area. This porous surface is of course not as conducive to cleaning as a smooth one.</description>

NOTES &amp;amp; QUOTES
pp17. &amp;ldquo;Recently, many designers have become excited about experimental material design, often driven by the need to find more sustainable material solutions. However, designers have often worked alone or within the designer community, without proper support to further develop and scale-up their most feasible ideas. At the same time, scientific material research has resulted in ground-breaking findings, which, with help from designers, could be applied in everyday life.</description>

      <description>Updated E- Bike Kit: 2021
Reason for updating:
The current version of the kit fits many types of bikes and is light and easy to attach/ remove but you have to be careful not to overstress the motor (by going up a hill, for example) because the ESC is dumb and will send more current than the motor windings can handle and they will burn out. The current design also uses a sliding 10K Ohm sliding potentiometer, mounted on the handlebar, as a throttle.</description>

      <description>Preparation
For this fist test, we prepared 4 petri dishes with rye straw in different forms. We also had some dried coconut fibre and so decided to prepare this for a test also.
Dish 1: Random Straw
First we prepared a dish with scraps of some of the larger diameter sections of straw from our supply, these were placed randomly in the dish to act as a control to compare its strength to the woven and layered straw tests.</description>

      <description>Mycelium Research in chronological order:
Textiles w/ mycelium: https://neffa.nl/portfolio/mycelium-textile/
Topic: Growing mycelium on textiles
Species: schizophyllum
Findings:
Mycelium does not like to grow on a tight knitted or woven fabric. It needs space and openness to grow. (oxygen)
The mycelium did no use the textiles as food, even over 6 months.

Ireland: Wheat straw tied with briar. the straw must be whole, not cut up by a machine like a harvester. The straw and briar must be well dead so there&amp;rsquo;s no sap in them. In this film, they don&amp;rsquo;t use any tools to twist and tie the straw.

Traditional craft fair: Here they use a tool called a &amp;ldquo;girth&amp;rdquo; made from a hollow and truncated animal horn to twist the straw and hold it tight as they tie it.</description>

      <description>Mock-Up: First Test
The First Try:
On the first try the motor arm wasn&amp;rsquo;t held securely enough to the clamp, despite the hex bolt being so tight that I felt the clamp would break if I turned it anymore. This meant that the smallest bump in the road or slipping of the motor on the wheel (for example if too much power is applied when the bike is not moving fast enough) can move the motor arm up and out of contact with the wheel.</description>

      <description>Building a Mock-Up for Testing: Prototype 0 (P0)
Reasons for Building a Mock-Up:
My next step was to move from the bench test to a first working mockup. The mockup I will make will be a simple seat post/tube mounted design.
Sketches: I need a mockup to test some important aspects of the design such as the positioning of the motor on the wheel (at what angle?), the amount of pressure needed to force the motor in to contact with the tyre (is a spring of some kind needed?</description>

https://github.com/waagsociety/air_quality_sensor_kit/tree/master/MUV%20Kit/Case
Introduction:
I was asked to make a case for the air quality sensor kit for the MUV urban mobility project. An open source citizen science project funded by the EU. To allow it to be easily reproduced by others, the case should use an existing waterproof electronics enclosure and readily available parts. Instructions and the needed files were all published to the MUV GitHub page here: The timeframe from receiving the case to delivering the finished prototype and its documentation was 1.</description>

      <description>Research Stage 3, 3/12/18 - 10/12/18:
To move from the desk test setup to the first ridable prototype, P1. I will need to buy a clamp for mounting to the seatpost or the bikes frame (these seem to be the most straightforward mounting locations so I will focus on them for the first mock-up). I think it makes sense to buy a commercial seat clamp (known as an &amp;ldquo;O-clamp&amp;rdquo; or an &amp;ldquo;axle clamp&amp;rdquo;) as they are readily available and made to fit the range of tube sizes.</description>

      <description>Research Stage 2 26/11/18 - 3/11/18:
Parts:
For my first prototype (P1), I chose to use the most simple equipment I could find to mock-up the power system for my motor. For this test, I just wanted to produce a mock-up that would allow me to adjust the speed of the motor with a throttle of some kind, using batteries which are similar in voltage to those I plan to use in my final version.</description>

      <description>Research Stage 1 19/11/18 - 25/11/18:
I began by researching the different types of e-bikes and the history of e-bikes overall. After settling on the friction drive as the variant which best fits my project, I looked into the existing friction drive offerings, both D.I.Y. and commercial. I found friction drive designs from the late 1800s until now. I particularly noticed the recent trend in popularity of small friction drive kits being released, often through crowdfunding.</description>

      <description>An Open E-Bike Kit
Motivation and the Idea:
As part of my internship at Fablab Amsterdam I will work on a project of my own. For this I chose to make an add-on E-bike kit, following the open design concept. I came to this idea after moving to the Netherlands and using a bike as daily transport for the first time. The cheapness and effectiveness of the bicycle are clear as is it’s lesser environmental impact vs the car.</description>
